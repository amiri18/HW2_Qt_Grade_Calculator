# Homework Assignment 2: Qt Grade Calculator
## Class Details:
This program constructs a fancy display for a grade calculator as well as actually calculates grades for courses pic10b and pic10c on two different grade schemes (A and B).

The grade break down for both schemes can be found at: http://pic.ucla.edu/%7Ersalazar/pic10c/assignments/hw2/index.html
## Programming Details:
My computer didn't have enough memory to let me download Qt, so I had to code the entire program at the pic lab and then upload it. This is why there are no commits. Because of this, I didn't get too familiar wiht Qt, but this project did help me learn the very basics like how functions, signals, and widgets work together.
### `grade_calculator.h`
This file contains the declarations for the constructor, destructor, and functions.
### `grade_calculator.cpp`
This file contains the definitions of the constructor, desturctor, and functions. In this file, it also shows how the objects are connected with signals (like the spinBoxs and horizontalSliders).
